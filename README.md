Using pytorch in school and at work inspired some curiousity in me about how CUDA actually works. This repo displays my attempt to figure it out. Currently working through the labs posted at the link below (Thanks Caltech!). All code should be runnable on AWS p2.xlarge EC2 instances, using the Amazon Linux 2 Deep Learning AMI.

lab1 - 1D Convolution<br/>
lab2 - shared memory matrix transpose

 * TODO for all kernels (including naive):
 * Leave a comment above all non-coalesced memory accesses and bank conflicts.
 * Make it clear if the suboptimal access is a read or write. If an access is
 * non-coalesced, specify how many cache lines it touches, and if an access
 * causes bank conflicts, say if its a 2-way bank conflict, 4-way bank
 * conflict, etc.
 *
 * Comment all of your kernels.

/*
 * Each block of the naive transpose handles a 64x64 block of the input matrix,
 * with each thread of the block handling a 1x4 section and each warp handling
 * a 32x4 section.
 *
 * If we split the 64x64 matrix into 32 blocks of shape (32, 4), then we have
 * a block matrix of shape (2 blocks, 16 blocks).
 * Warp 0 handles block (0, 0), warp 1 handles (1, 0), warp 2 handles (0, 1),
 * warp n handles (n % 2, n / 2).
 *
 * This kernel is launched with block shape (64, 16) and grid shape
 * (n / 64, n / 64) where n is the size of the square matrix.
 *
 * You may notice that we suggested in lecture that threads should be able to
 * handle an arbitrary number of elements and that this kernel handles exactly
 * 4 elements per thread. This is OK here because to overwhelm this kernel
 * it would take a 4194304 x 4194304    matrix, which would take ~17.6TB of
 * memory (well beyond what I expect GPUs to have in the next few years).

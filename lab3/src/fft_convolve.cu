Atomic-max function. You may find it useful for normalization.

We haven't really talked about this yet, but __device__ functions not
only are run on the GPU, but are called from within a kernel.

    Also remember to scale by the padded length of the signal

    There are many ways to do this reduction, and some methods
    have much better performance than others. 

    For this section: Please explain your approach to the reduction,
    including why you chose the optimizations you did
    (especially as they relate to GPU hardware).

    You'll likely find the above atomicMax function helpful.
    (CUDA's atomicMax function doesn't work for floating-point values.)
    It's based on two principles:
        1) From Week 2, any atomic function can be implemented using
        atomic compare-and-swap.
        2) One can "represent" floating-point values as integers in
        a way that preserves comparison, if the sign of the two
        values is the same. (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/

        compare-float-in-cuda)
